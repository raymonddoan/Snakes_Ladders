## Statement of Purpose and Scope

Based on the physical game, this application emulates the ancient game 'Snakes and Ladders'. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders):

> Snakes and Ladders, known originally as Moksha Patam, is an ancient Indian board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic. It is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares.

This purpose of this application is to provide a free version of the game that can be run on the terminal. The development of this application is to entertain the users with an ancient old game. The target audience are people who getting into programming or who love games, ages from 6+. Launching the game through the .exe file and adding in their name will allow them to start the game.

## Features List

### Features List - MVP

<!--- This is where you put in the user stores --->

- As an user, I want to be able to enter my name. This requires user `input` to type their name and will use the `capitalise` function to place their initials on the board.  
- As an user, I want to be able to roll the dice. Once it is the player's turn, they will be required to press the 'return' key to launch the dice roll.
- As an user, I want to be able to view what the previous rolls were. By entering 'P' key, the user will be able to see their previous rolls. 

### Other Features List - TBC

- As an user, I want to be able to view the leader board as to who reached the end of the board with the least amount of rolls.
- As an user, I want to be able to visually see the dice.

## User Experience (UX) Outline

- The app gives clear instructions to the user
- The app handles errors gracefully, and gives helpful error messages to the user
